## Requirements
- A licensed version of GAMS. Maybe I'll make a python version in the future.
- Python 3.7+ and Anaconda

## Reproduction
1. Clone the repository. If you think you will want to make changes, it's best to fork it first, then clone your fork.
2. Navigate to your local working copy, create an environment and install dependencies:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

3. Activate environment

`conda activate loaded-dice`

4. Run the scripts in numerical order from the `scripts` directory

`python scripts/<script_name.py>`
